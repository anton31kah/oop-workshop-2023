- `part0` contains the base code after completing the main part of the problem.
- `part1` contains the code after completing the first expansion of the problem. The differences between `part0` and `part1` are:
  - In `Main`: the `if` that checks the split parts length.
- `part2` contains the code after completing the second expansion of the problem. The differences between `part1` and `part2` are:
  - In `Main`: the `if`s that check whether the `index` is an integer and in the contacts list.
  - In `Phonebook`: the new method `hasContactAtIndex`.
- `part3` contains the code after completing the third expansion of the problem. The differences between `part2` and `part3` are:
  - In `Main`: the last part of the while loop that checks for name changes.
  - In `Phonebook`: the new method `updateName`.
- `part4` contains the code after completing the fourth expansion of the problem. The differences between `part3` and `part4` are:
  - In `Main`: addition of a code segment right at the beginning that adds the possibility of manually defining contacts.
